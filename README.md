# CTF_Writeups
A collection of CTF Writeups

My goal with these write ups is to give myself a frame of reference for my thought process on each machine, helping me identify places where I struggle or could do better. Toward that goal, there are two important components of the write ups. First, generally they will contain a "Key takeaways" section, these contain the main points that I struggled with, and what I should keep in mind moving forward. Second, most write ups here will contain my entire thought process throughout solving the box, not just what was successful. For that reason, they may be a bit longer.
